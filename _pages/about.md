Hi, I’m Eleftherios — though my friends and most people call me Lefteris! I am an incoming PhD student (currently in a pre-doctoral position) at [École Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en), where I am fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Vicky Kalogeiton](https://vicky.kalogeiton.info/). I am part of the [VISTA](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/vista/) team at the [Computer Science Laboratory](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/) (LIX). Prior to this, I was affiliated with the [Artificial Intelligence & Learning Systems](https://www.ails.ece.ntua.gr/) (AILS) Lab, working under the guidance of Prof. [Athanasios Voulodimos](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en/staff/492) and Dr. [Paraskevi Tzouveli](http://www.image.ntua.gr/~tpar/). Before this, I earned my Diploma in [Electrical & Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) from the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) (NTUA).

My research interests are broadly on generative AI, with a particular interest in diffusion models and their applications.
